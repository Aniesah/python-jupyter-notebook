Elementary Physics IIA [`Ã—`](https://akademik.itb.ac.id/app/dosen:197312011999031002/kurikulum/silabus/40547/view)

+ This course is designed to give the common basic concepts of elementary physics for undergraduate students.
+ It covers electrostatics, Gauss law, electric potential and energy, capacitor, magnetostatics, electromotive force and magnetic induction, alternating current, electromagnetic wave, modern physics, and atomic physics.
+ Python in Jupyter notebook use in this course is optional but encouraged since it can support mathematical equations and display numerical examples interactively at the same time.


## topics
+ Point charge, discrete charge distribution, continues charge distribution, electric field lines, Coulomb's law, Gauss' law.
+ Work, potential energy, electrostatic force, electric potential, capacitor and dielectric.
+ Lorentz force, particle accelerator, velocity selector, mass spectroscopy, indueced potential difference, Hall effect.
+ Magnetic force, magnetic field, Biot-Savart law, Ampere's law.
+ Electromagnetic induction, Faraday`s law, Lenz's law.
+ Alternatic current, reactance, impedance, series and parallel circuits, resonance.
+ Wave equation, electromagnetic wave, Ponyting vector, polarisation.
+ Double slit interference, multiple slit interference, thin film interference.
+ Single slit diffraction, double slit diffraction, multiple slit diffraction.
